## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Building features instead of moats (features are copyable)
- ❌ Trying to build all 7 moat types at once
- ❌ Ignoring data collection early (start logging everything)
- ❌ Making it easy to export/leave before you have lock-in
- ❌ Competing on price alone (race to the bottom)
